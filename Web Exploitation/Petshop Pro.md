Due to the hint we could try to change the price to 0, we got the first flag.

## Hints1
- There must be a way to administer the app
- Tools may help you find the entrypoint
- Tools are also great for finding credentials
## Flag1
To find a way to administer the app, we could brute force the other paths. I used dirb command with a list of common names: [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Usernames/Names).

After some time, I investigated the `/login` path.

I tried some injections here, but they didn't work, so we had to brute-force again.

I used Turbo Intruder extension of BurpSuite, first i sent bruteforce username with [this](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Usernames/Names) common name list. If the username exist, it doesn't return `Invalid username`, so I filtered it out by the following code:

Then I repeated the process to find the password using [this](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt) word list, filtering by  `Invalid password`.

After obtaining the username and password, I logged into the website and got the second flag.

## Hints2
- Always test every input
- Bugs don't always appear in a place where the data is entered
## Flag2

Now that we administered the website and had more places to exploit, I tried some XSS on the `/edit` page and got the final flag when went back to the `/cart` page.
