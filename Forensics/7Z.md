## Solution
The challenge provides a password-protected RAR file. To brute-force the password, I used the `John the Ripper` tool.

First, clone the repository and build the tool in your working directory, otherwise it won't work. 
Use the following commands: `git clone "https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper.git" && cd JohnTheRipper/src && ./configure && sudo make -s clean && sudo make -sj4`. 

Then I used `rar2john` to extract hashes from the RAR file: `john-the-ripper.rar2john 7Z.rar > hash`

Then brute-force the password with `rockyou.txt` word list: `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash`

After extracting the RAR file, I got a corrupted file.

Using HexEd.it, I found that the bytes in the file were swapped. For example, `I H D R` was swapped to `H I R D`.

I came up with a script that fix this, shout out to chatGPT.

```python
  def reverse_file_contents(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as infile: 
        contents = infile.read()
    
    reversed_contents = contents[::-1] 
    
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as outfile: 
        outfile.write(reversed_contents)

if _name_ == "_main_":
    input_file = r'C:\Users\ADMIN\Downloads\chall.jpg'  
    output_file = r'C:\Users\ADMIN\Downloads\rev.txt'  
    reverse_file_contents(input_file, output_file)
```
Fixing the corrupted PNG file led us to a GitHub repository containing encrypted strings: https://github.com/H4lst0n/naunau

With magic tool from [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), I quickly decode the strings and got the flag.
